university author note table contents answer a2 answer b8 answer c13 references16 answer in terms economics firm production operation experiences several phenomena relevant implications production pricing levels concerned company. one phenomenon economies scale. by term economies scale cost advantage firm starts enjoying increase production good service produces meant. in general total cost production firm divided broadly two types namely total fixed cost total variable cost carlino 2012 . the former one incurred firm irrespective amount output produced firm. however latter one depends number units production firm. therefore production firm goes increasing average fixed cost production firm goes decreasing thereby reducing overall average cost production varian 2014 . this phenomenon gives rise known economies scale firm may also lead decrease average variable cost production firm. the economies scale broadly divided two categories internal economies scale well external economies scale. these two concepts varying according nature economies scale elaborated follows internal economies scale a firm increasing productive activities experience several economies scale production process specifically limited concerned firm enjoyed industry whole. these economies scale termed internal economies scale. for example firm may especially skilled labor particular production adept marketing team available firms industry therefore gives firm scope enjoying internal economies scale argyres zenger 2012 . firm ac ac1 ac2 ac 0 q1 q2 firm q figure 1 internal economies scale source as created author b external economies scale the type economies scale known external economies scale hand refers advantages firm gets due operation particular industry. in words

much countrys share trade activities nature goods services traded country depends economies scale country enjoying enjoying buera kaboski 2012 . trade nature two types namely interindustry trade intraindustry trade discussed following section interindustry trade this type trade generally occurs two different industries products industries distinctively different. for example agriculturally rich country produce crops huge surplus trade surplus crops another country prospering machine manufacturing exchange products. the main factor influencing nature extent interindustry trade countries respective comparative advantages production enjoyed trading countries melitz trefler 2012 . intraindustry trade this notion trade comparatively newer notion. intraindustry trade means trading products belong industry. in simpler words two countries involve trading products belonging industry known intraindustry trade. for example country make family car trade sports car produced another country products belonging automobile industry vona 2013 . over recent decades concept intraindustry trade gained significant popularity expansions technological innovations occurring different industries world. nowadays specialization categorization products industry producing various types products crude basics products remaining similar. therefore specialization production well factors production different countries becoming adept producing different products industry thereby calling intraindustry trades countries feenstra 2015 . however concept intraindustry trade go par many traditional trade theories including hechsherohlin theory trade according countries export goods services easily produced factors production abundantly present particular country helpman razin 2014 . going theory industry country experiences factor abundance country export product produced concerned industry. however intraindustry trade involves trading different products industry two countries thereby challenging conceptual framework traditional trade theories bowen hollander viaene 2012 . however intraindustry trade concept explained help concept economies scale two types discussed previous sections. like comparative advantage concept external economies scale also significant implications intraindustry trade scenario country external economies scale achieved firm due overall growth industry belongs anything specialization maccharles 2012 . however occurs internal economies scale particular firm specific industry due endogenous factors subjected firm advent specialization production particular type product produced firm occurrence intraindustry trade seems feasible practical. the real life instance japan producing different type cars mainly sports car germany producing type cars focusing making family cars mostly getting trade clear example intraindustry trade. this trade relation arises internal economies scale several firms industry whole madeira 2014 . intraindustry trade like forms trade gaining significant importance time major economic giants getting involved type trade increasingly. one dominant example growth intraindustry trade global scenario traderelation dynamics two influential economies world united states america united kingdom. these two countries enjoying significant economic relations one another overtime trade relations strengthened countries venturing different industries. the usa still biggest trading partner uk economies enjoying significant market products economy census.gov 2017 . the trade relation two countries helped increasing overall well dominance global market. the lions share trade relations two countries interindustry type nature advent time specializations industries counties also started enjoying benefits intraindustry trade. this intraindustry relation developing specifically food beverage industry automobile industry labor market countries ito okubo 2012 . britain remained one chief exporters cars usa also world. surprisingly country also importer automobiles vehicle parts nature utilities vehicles imported different vehicles exported country. this facilitated intraindustry trade usa uk. apart sector significant labor emigration immigration take place countries long time due difference skills specializations labour difference labor requirements countries thereby indicating

activities countries. in words newly industrialized countries ones highly developing countries significant rise share industries industrial activities economy concerned countries kulessa 2012 . with time countries get included category go experiencing significant dynamics economic progress overall development. the notable example newly industrialized countries hong kong taiwan singapore south korea asian tigers brazil india china mexico countries. over time countries shown highly impressive performances economic growth indicators global scenario. in many cases gdp growth rates nics even

industrialized countries last decades destek 2016 . taiwan case study taiwan one four economic giants forming powerful cartel asian tigers developed significantly last decades thereby taking position one significant nics world. with consistently high economic growth productive activities country expected catch first world countries time. the country developed significant export sector exports continually increasing time made position one biggest asian exporters global business market. much goods services form export sector country hitech highly technology based nature country continually

country fields innovation. this turn highly likely effect substantial expenditures country fields research development overall investment country skill building emphasizing human capital cumulatively facilitated pace innovations technological progress country lin et al. 2014 . answer c the term optimum currency area refers geographical area consisting different economies sharing single currency. this often done facilitate trade mobility factors production goods services different regions falling optimum currency area. generally optimum currency area refers geographical conglomeration one country basic notion facilitate trade commercial relations intercountry framework. however optimum currency area intraregion type too. this part assignment deals economic phenomenon optimum currency area viability euro zone example optimum currency area. the eurozone refers union several european countries monetary terms thereby accepting single currency euro case common currency. among 28 members european union 19 members come together form recent euro zone. first formed 11 countries 1999 economic region included european countries time emerged one largest economic zones history world common currency euro liquid currencies world lapavitsas 2012 . there substantial debate regarding viability euro zone optimum economic zone new age global scenario. the basic economic notion behind creation euro zone actually objective making member countries achieve significant growth economies facilitating trade transactions others market thereby making cartel optimum economic zone. the initial rapid growth euro zone potential showed emerge one powerful economic conglomeration global scenario would become optimum economic zone provided severe turmoil occurred monetary cartel moberg 2015 . for monetary cartel several regions obtain status optimum economic zone necessary definitely sufficient create shared common currency only. for economic union successful robust economic political regulatory frameworks prevailing among neighbor countries significant monitoring controlling power required hands regulate union. the euro zone though started showing impressive growth initial years creation union lacked proper management foresightedness. the growths small members fully dependent strategies taken large members union thereby making vulnerable economic uncertainties. the common currency low interest rate kept union actually affecting small member countries adversely experiencing high debt burdens. the crisis eurozone began bankruptcy one member countries greece 2009 2011 crisis escalated huge level several countries including portugal spain italy ireland also showing potential becoming sovereign debt defaulters. the recent event brexit involving withdrawal uk european union 2016 gave another shocking blow monetary union european countries lin treichel 2012 . therefore seen discussion eurozone though potential become optimum economic zone future still considered one despite impressive performances initial phase creation union. sufficient reframing reforming policies regulations done respect union economic union benefits member countries bigger

in order catdom custom department competitive provide quality services characterized effectiveness efficiencies number strategies department needs implement. some solution problems includes change procedures structural development adoption wco trs recommendations customs regulation compliance. change procedures inspection regulations the current inspection procedures increase delays due old inspection method used. there need modernize procedures used inspect containers cargo airport seaport. according burns 2014 current modern custom departs incorporate ict major part system eases operations. the current method used department purely manual order ease congestion delay within department due manual inspections need change laws regulations guide whole process introduce ict. this implies whole system needs review modernization aims using current advanced surveillance inspection technology capability automatically inspect container. this ict system also incorporated modern payment system uses electronic payment methods reduce issues cheque cash payment. moreover modernization department also solve issue inexperienced employees work specifically using computers instead manual. nevertheless effective technological application clearance customs operations management laws guiding department operation must amended united nations conference trade development 2008 . structural development another solution delay uncompetitive custom system structural development department. for instance department agriculture customs departments seaport share office leading uncoordinated operations seaport burns 2014 . this means limited structure offices contain employees officers needed perform smooth operation. the government needs improve structure help increase efficiencies department. still structural development development focus development installation loading offloading straddle carriers fitted modern inspection devices automatically several work time. this likely reduce number hours take queuing assessed. therefore upgrading improving structure within department accommodate expansion increasing number customer available department. the airport needs structurally upgraded include modern scrutiny quality cross border trade racz weippl seufert 2010 . increase resource allocation the customs department needs resources especially financial resources evidence senior executive management. failure payment system resulted 10 bonus payment offered management reflects poor payment strategy limited financial resource available remuneration employees. the custom treasury department needs consider current remuneration system employees review conditions lead remuneration coupled increase financial resources. the budgetary allocation improved help strengthen department since financial resources used develop structure upgrade operating systems. financial resources also used risk mitigation prevention method failure lead collapse whole custom department hans 2002 . risk management the government catdom needs introduce formulate risk management system assist risk management consistency world customs organization wco world customs organisation 2012 . the government consider developing risk management procedures include risk assessment risk evaluation risk mitigation prevention measures. as highlighted wco identification potential risk associated inspection payment duties airport seaport important efficiencies department tarantino 2008 . the government needs also develop laws regulations ensure risk practices reduced. this implies government coming risk assessment evaluation procedures help identify risk develop strategies mitigate them. in addition risk prevention mitigation procedures also important risk management. for instance risk associated poor payment methods lead useless cheques yet risk management system help tackle problem well problem actually happen mallik 2010 . adoption world customs organization guidelines trs recommendations world customs organizations trs provided guidelines ensure full compliance regulations citing measures streamline transboarder movement goods. these guidelines adopted catdom customs department ensure good competitive department. firstly application modern technologies outlined wco trs may rectify situation currently experienced customs department. this takes considerations performance measurement systems. the wco also provides software developed jointly world bank called trs software provides efficient technological application customs system. the system gives it applications system smoothen clearance time world customs organization trs 2011 . implementation modern technologies operations apart structural development also includes technological development current modern technological application important aspect custom department. tcscan system one modern systems scan inspect cargo containers automatically reducing time takes manual inspection silveira et al 2012 . the system automatically inspects content container without opening hence ensures full compliance customs requirement. tcscan system utilizes records goods transported part inspection ensure storing containers limited time locating specific containers. secondly loading offloading fitted tcscan system devices ensure record documentation location content containers consistency requirement. tcscan system therefore needs included structural development reduces delay. this system successfully used seaport seaport shanghai china luc jos 2005 . conclusion in conclusion catdom custom department experience delays affects competitiveness department also international trade. the current procedure laws guide port operation within customs department cause delays therefore need changes review. this increase resource allocation department structural development implementation modern information system upgrading customs system meet

renewable energy push initiated indian government. the major issue contention high gst rate 28 applicable batteries used electric vehicles solar energy storage mishra 2017 . the objective essay highlight impact high gst critically analyse case lowering same. impact gst lowering battery market as gst indirect tax hence reduction 28 5 demanded manufacturers would lead lowering price consequent increase equilibrium quantity. this account lowering gst producers supply batteries would increase mankiw 2014 . this represented shift supply curve indicated arnold 2008 . owing increase supply battery manufacturers equilibrium price would decrease indicated p1 p2. also equilibrium quantity would increase q1 currently q2. hence apparent reduction gst would enable government realise stated agenda 100 electric vehicles 2030 besanko braeutigam 2010 . besides provide spur solar energy production well batteries required storage power used later time. also diagram apparent would increase producer surplus well consumer surplus owing decrease deadweight loss account levying tax. this account lower prices buyers overall lower tax burden sellers krugman wells 2008 . impact gst lowering electric vehicle market it known one parts required manufacturing electric vehicles battery. when gst battery tends reduce 28 5 essentially would lower cost battery procured suppliers. this would lower cost manufacturing electric vehicle manufacturers mankiw 2014 . as result supply curve would tend right highlighted diagram indicated below. on account increased supply due lower costs lowering equilibrium price electric vehicles making affordable customers. additionally equilibrium quantity would also increase lower price demand higher requisite supply would also available. as result lowering gst clearly provides impetus consumption electrical vehicles. in short run profits would increase demand electric vehicles inelastic considering necessity nicholson snyder 2011 . hence prices lowered proportionate increase demand would much higher leading higher profits generated even cost savings passed consumers. however long run elasticity decreases competition increases profitability increase would largely eroded arnold 2008 . impact gst lowering petrol vehicle market it apparent electric vehicles petrol vehicles substitutes hence move tends increase consumption electric vehicles would adverse impact consumption petrol vehicles. it apparent decrease gst batteries renewable energy would lead increased consumption electric vehicles account lower prices would become affordable customers. as affordability electric vehicles improves become competitive relation petrol run vehicles. this would lead certain consumers prefer electric vehicles petrol run vehicles krugman wells 2008 . therefore would result lowering demand petrol vehicles indicated following graph. as result lowering demand would decrease equilibrium price equilibrium quantity apparent graph indicated above. in short run even though price would decrease possible long run prices may recover especially lowering prices make petrol vehicles competitive electric vehicles assuming constant consumer preferences pindyck rubinfeld 2001 . proposal based discussion apparent strong case decrease gst batteries used renewable sector. this especially perspective electric vehicles still limited acceptance indian market price still continues main driver environmental concerns. additionally electric vehicle recurring cost form battery would required certain time battery would need replaced. higher cost batteries would act deterrent consumers time buying vehicle also regards replacing battery time time. as result continuation high gst batteries would good idea government serious intentions make big field electric vehicles economic feasibility would remain significant parameter consumers thus government along manufacturer need take measures limit battery cost nicholson snyder 2011 . conclusion the discussion sections clearly indicates lowering gst would lead lower prices thus higher equilibrium quantity augers well renewable energy sector coupled future electric vehicles. since battery input hence lowering cost would lead lower cost producer hence possible generate higher profit especially short run. further petrol vehicles demand would adversely impacted account rising quantity consumed electric vehicles. hence concerned minister must consider plea lowering gst batteries. references arnold a.r. 2008 . microeconomics 9th ed. . sydney cengage learning. besanko d. braeutigam r.

associated 15 percent reduction noncompliance labour standards example time wages well benefits. in 1990s global boycott campaign became successful showed industry giants accounted consumers stakeholders. then nike board member jill ker conway visited several factories nike identified many ways improved bringing change relationship management workers griffinsmith 2016 . thus nike started making commitments longstanding suppliers implement lean transformation. the transformation lean required higher commitment contract factories. many factories change physical layout entire shop floor managers responsible lean manufacturing appointed sent training sri lanka. even nikes president ceo mark parker discussed design keeps ion changing helps propelling 60 billion business ahead. they try overcome resistance change innovating new ways example new flyknit running shoes brownlee 2013 . this indicates change issue rather resistance change major problem. lean helped nike workers assigned responsibility individually towards quality control well started finding techniques improve overall production. this helped increasing skill sets well added value business rick 2013 . 3. implementing contingency approach change management contingency approach quite different approach towards change works various circumstances. the change model incorporates soft well award approaches model two dimensional matrix two categories scale change style management need used organization order facilitate change. out four strategies organizational change participative evolution charismatic transformation forced evolution dictatorial transformation nike adopts charismatic transformation. for example case nike ceo phil knight responded campus apparel focus groups well campus protests

institute technology 20th century initially 8000 faculties 10000 students brynjolfsson 2013 . the students face immense pressure outsiders institute face critical challenge associated budget. the federal growth expenditure us seriously affect institute carlino 2014 . the budget research significantly got lowered suffered severely. on hand tuition fee students significantly got aroused. many students faced difficulties could get admission one prestigious institutes world davenport 2013 . these problems ultimately made increment gap eventually mit faced hurdles attract stakeholders. that mit decided convert prevalent financial system maintime financial information davenport 2016 . mit thus considered two approaches first strategy develop single improved system institute approach purchase similar system institute. mit decided buy erp system institute multiple complications regarding building erp systems scratch mit ready handle complications deloitte consulting 2015 . the erp

organisations successfully implemented erp system premises enhance financial activities sarkis sundarraj 2013 . mit inspired success erp system implemented premises too. they urge adopt corporate culture within premises want embellish operational efficiency cutting heavy expenses. hence took decision adopt erp system premises could assist face overcome financial crisis. massachusetts institute technology taken significant approach enhance business activities within institute stewart et al 2015 . they invested lot money invested around 5 billion erp system. they tried overcome financial crisis facing weil 2015 . according modern trends keeping mind modern demand market erp vendors taking initiatives increase market share sap oracle dominant market shareholder. however despite best efforts massachusetts institute technology could apply software successfully premises 60 80 educational institutes failed execute application massachusetts institute technology exception wilderman 2014 . erp built keeping mind business organisation success organisations. erp capabilities offer varied customisation solutions however customisation options responsible failure properly optimised. therefore risks associated it. to mitigate risks project scope must analysed installation cost budget associated must taken consideration. these parameters followed project may fail miserably project get delayed colombatto mccarthy 2017 . thus erp case study created lot tensions panic massachusetts institute technology affected many ways lost money invested. 6. conclusion it concluded discourse educational institutes adopting erp premises integrate business activities manage complicated activities ease. the colleges universities educational institutes competing among provide best educational facilities students minimal costs decrement investment government increment stakeholder. this reason institutes focussed erp systems similarly erp system becoming attractive educational institutes. the erp capability offer standards institutes. the erp system beneficial organisations educational institutes world. in case educational institutes erp help reengineer business activities well

neutrality applies ensures services applied across europe without blocking throttling discrimination internet traffic guided three exceptions. 1.compliance legal obligations 2.network integrity 3.managing congestion exceptional situations national regulatory authorities nras authorized access traffic management commercial practices agreements. they power set quality standards ensure good quality open internet access endusers. in 2016 body european regulators electronic communications berec coordination commission issued guidelines help nras assessing inter alia agreements commercial practices reach consistent decision actions. nras prepare annual country reports submit commission berec help implement net neutrality rules granados 2017 open internet the argument various reasons arguments exists among people dealing internet stakeholders involve government service providers telecommunication companies end users etc. all reasons prove favourability nonfavourability open internet. stating arguments consider ethical side net neutrality. the net neutrality states signal traffic internet prioritized other. people side claim open internet obstructs main internet market infrastructure. a big organization money tend block content startups new upcoming organizations promote content. the supporters open internet worried much authority fcc federal communications commission end users concerned government interfering free internet market gross 2014 . there multiple ethical issues followed arguments. before apply ethical theories open internet lets pen possible options 1.a complete execution net neutrality without prioritization signals purpose destination. 2.a limited execution net neutrality isps decide exceptions like blocking particular signals applications. 3.a complete free market without open internet isps sole decision makers form rules end users decide isp want avail services from. utilitarianism applied net neutrality utilitarianism ethical theory says outcome action sole standards right wrong. the best action anything one maximizes value anything. various opinions flows multiple discussions ethical theories applied know best possible solution words come decision maximizes final outcome. considering business ethics perspective sides considering decisions right benefit maximum people michel weidman 2015 . using utilitarian theory suggests strengthening net neutrality lead goal open internet rules benefit maximum people. the telecommunication companies would experience decline utility open internet would less innovation freedom speech. the utility isps would depend organization size. the end users equal access everything internet hence increase utility them. considering side net neutrality telecom companies keep imposing charges increase profits big companies money dominate smaller ones paying faster internet fcc rules regulate internet flow end users keep getting limited access various sites chung xing 2011 . doing total weightage sides calculating final utility say maximum people benefit net neutrality utilitarian perspective seems ethical. deontology applied net neutrality the deontological ethical theory moral quality acts cite principals maxims categorical imperative test. the acts failing tests considered morally wrong. each individual right give weightage likes dislikes. these maxims aims individual whether right wrong . the act right maxim individual aiming become universal law. so maxim people favor net neutrality would mean discrimination opposing would mean discriminate. on basis categorical imperative approach deontology theory individuals practical reasons action logical consistency. if individual everyone agree particular maxim action right. the service providers authority interfere internet permits. as discrimination morally wrong hence deontology would favor net neutrality equal right everyone use internet various applications given 2007 . to make ethically morally right decision practical logical approach seems best net neutrality. virtue theory applied net neutrality virtue theory emphasizes moral character compared ethical duties regulations. it believes eudemonism means goals good life achieved practicing virtue daytoday life geddes 2016 . this theory believes open internet would increase innovation signals networks would followed increase value internet access final internet users would willing spend value. ultimately would create virtuous circle. the main conclusion theory depends flexible regulatory approach downes 2017 . contract theory applied net neutrality this theory study agreements formed two parties may two individuals business organizations form specific rules agreed both. this theory believes getting contract lead moral living individuals. considering contract theory exists agreement end users service providers data charges user agrees pay receive data services. there also exists agreement different service providers specific terms. hence case violation agreement service providers side isps responsible resolve it. from mutually agreed terms agreements theory would stand net neutrality. however option 2 given paper could solution consideration contract theory audibert murray 2016 . conclusion the internet basic need today every individual every business. absence net neutrality service providers controlling

health care worker modify perception behaviour dealing elderly patients minimise potential challenges provide effective health care. the essay follows case study dorothy 71year old greek widow presented emergency unit following broken arm result fall home. the primary contributing factor incident alcohol due isolation friends family late husband. the patient experiences memory loss forgetfulness fatigue depression aggressive behaviour attributes feeling judged others. although patient diagnosed dementia concern might forget take medication relieve pain broken arm. also patient verbally aggressive noncompliant hospital something makes hard physicists monitor situation effectively. all problems caused falls loss memory black able stand long things make hard patient discharged since may return drinking routine. factors influencing interaction elderly patients healthcare providers there myriad factors determine quality service delivered physicist regard interaction patient write look two common healthcare constructs. patient behaviour cooperation case scenario evident patient cooperate fully service provided. at time healthcare provider worried patient could discharged go home resume drinking. the patient also attributes verbally aggressive behaviour feeling judged others. providers level competence case scenario point healthcare provider competent work. he understands opioids alcohol adverse effects body hence need alcohol withdrawal program. throughout case scenario well presented doctor versed work level competence high. why constructs challenging first patients cooperation involvement challenging since helps determining quality healthcare service delivery. clinical outcome depends entirely behaviour patient ability give information cooperation healthcare providers drenthvan maanen et al. 2009 . even nurse job well client follow medical orders objective achieved. for example noncompliance dorothy hospital make hard physicist provide effective quality care patient. patients trust also significant achieving desired results. ekdahl et al. 2010 assert providing information disease condition help improve patient doctor interaction also ease process treatment. second practitioners knowledge competence technical skills also challenging since determine quality healthcare service lerolle et al. 2010 . hence health experts need improve competencies deliver standard services. if health care provider competent enough required skills hard provide effective health care especially aggressive non compliant elderly patients. modifying perceptions to ensure effectiveness health care delivery first health care providers provide options whenever possible according mangin 2007 vast number elderly patients desire keep sense independence. whenever possible provide choices choose since ability exercise choice patient greater sense confidence security esteem. for case dorothy insisting going back home doctor provide alternative feels patients go back home resume drinking habit. second health care providers provided enough training education deal different types clients especially elderly. it noted effective healthcare delivery involves decision client provider hence patients given chance make rightful decisions involved decision making ruiz et al. 2013 . lastly providers exercise patience compassion slow

useful diverse planning actions upon capital budgeting corporate decision. sensitivity analysis assists association making calculations allocation probable irr npv investment proposal circumstance impacted subsequently company make alteration sole variable reliant scenery. this sensitivity analysis could occur altering single variable time period. sensitivity analysis calculates rate every variable proposes decision making procedure corporation decide best investment project moles parrino kidwekk 2011 . for instance selling price product would deducted 20 consequently irr would also distorted due changes life project 5 years 3 years. thus analysis assists company take superior decision proposal investment. according instance every aspect would altered due various changes particular variable proposal. for instance changes happened selling price would change net present value investment project projects total life would make collision irr. then estimated npv drafted graph express sensitivity npv could take place due various changes aspects tsanakas millossovich 2016 . the graph express slope npv chart express sensitivity net present value occurred due make variations every input. the sharp slope sensitivity net present value create modifications variable. pic seitzinger et al 2010 companies widely use technique technique quite simple focuses many related estimates. mainly technique helpful companies make decision related finance aspects. scenario analysis scenario analysis studied tool capital budgeting technique make better corporate decision goodness company. sensitivity analysis widely used technique risk analysis study limits. conversely sensitivity analysis supreme contact variety probability distributions numerous inputs. additionally scenario analysis also helps company combine variables united effect might investigated alteration 1 variable bierman smidt 2012 . the scenario analysis provides detailed answer particular issues. mainly scenario analysis answers problem terrible could investment project look. multiple times companies make assumption factors forget take assumptions according previous assumption rivals relation environmental economy consideration etc. in analysis various factors measured according scenario analysis could made companies. these factors could array economical state rivalrys response action company. further components calculate number every factor scenario analysis. essentially best average worst three scenarios considered scenario analysis make best decision investment proposal garrison et al 2010 . though observed long range could varied. the next component analysis make focus various critical aspects make scenario factor. and end scenarios probabilities calculated. this scenario might based upon various macro factors like exchange rate interest rate numerous micro factors like reaction competitor. factors normal case best case worst case yield + 10 20 exchange rate + 10 10

exclusion feeling loneliness amongst friends family members loss work go jobs schools others. bereavement may defined period loss individuals experiences grief different symptoms ill effects occur physical mental well social lives madrell 2016 . the time spent period bereavement depends entirely intensity attachment individual person died along fact much time spent anticipate loss. mourning may defined process people mainly undertake adapt loss. researchers suggested mourning mainly influenced cultural customs well rituals society rules modify coping mechanism losses sidaway 2016 . an interesting discussion set scenario would help know various faces grief different experiences gathered individual along feeling grief. all types grief alike may provide different types reactions. when individual loses near dear person life deep pain develop. he would hurt extensively type loss reflects immense role played demised person latters life creation huge hole left demised persons absence.

these tasks model also encourage model develop active approach entire procedure grieving. the first task proposed author accept reality loss. it seen many cases even death particular loved member seen many individuals cannot accept fact death often consider depth taken place cannot accept reality ayers et al. 2014 . the fast task griever would face reality loved member dead. he accept fact member gone would never return back implies reunion never possible deceased person. a person may exposed prolong process grief individual denies fact loss well meaning meaning loss smit 2015 . the feeling irreversibility loss add pain individual going through. although denial hope reunion normal immediately loss may lead severed situation therefore individual accept reality situation prepare mind accordingly. the next step experiencing pain grief loss. a large number grievers often noticed researchers avoid painful feelings taking number strategies strong moving away keeping one self busy different tasks also avoiding painful thoughts. this task states grievers take extra initiative avoid pain stroebe schutt 2016 . he go natural procedures experience well express feelings. the patient recall relate pleasant unpleasant memories deceased patient allow experience anger anxiety loneliness guilt depression similar others. the grievers maintain transparency form family members social circle expressing need utilities often people may misunderstand needs grieving. the grievers know memory loved one continue pain related lessen time ultimately disappear domingo et al. 2016 . the third task model would adjust environment feeling missing deceased. often step perceived different grievers different ways depending upon relationship used share departed soul. they take imitative would help adjust present situation alter lifestyles principle others would help adjust occurrences wilson 2013 . this could explained help example. a person widowed may fear even show resentment developing new skills suit newly occurred change conditions lives take roles previously followed departed persons. often grievers may need help advice order suit new chances surrounding griever take pride able master challenges overcoming different barriers larson et al. 2014 .all may cause tremendous pain individuals may make remember partners necessary experience. if task completed fully grievers may remain blocked within grief process able resolve losses. the last step would withdraw emotional energy thereby reinvest emotional energy important relationship order continue productive life. this necessarily mean griever find new replacement deceased member finding new spouse surrogate mother others. by stage griever reenter new stream life without presence deceased individual. the griever task build new well changed activities well relationships young 2014 . this however taken griever accomplishing task dishonoring memory deceased individual griever loves less. this task helps griever balanced simply recognizing fact many people also need well many others also love capable loving charlotte gepphart 2010 . one also need discuss strength well weakness model. many others researchers often provide positive review model state flexible model model allows griever move backward forward task. by statement researchers mainly wanted say tasks need occurred sequence like mentioned one jump forward backward tasks. however true advantageous grievers complete one task completion next task best outcomes. moreover worden also stated course lifetime many tasks may sometimes need revisited best completion stages mourning bugglas 2010 . however negative aspect none models grief mourning proved centpercent valid develop best outcomes. many researchers found many positive evidences benefitting model also many researchers whose evidences go utility models. many grievers complain remain stuck within particular model many days panic cannot complete task cannot proceed task. moreover model set timeframes often found grievers remain shifting form one task another unable finally come model successfully may require high time affects quality life currier et al. 2015. hence entire essay concluded loss loved one often result individual develop grief bereavement. these turn may lead physical disorders mental health may also compromised. the individuals may withdraw completely social life. all may affect quality life making enveloped pain distress stress despair. hence following wordens theory model mourning may provide great guidance grievers. they may undertake

institution name youth justice in modern era youth delinquency proved problematic handle. there increasing cases youth offending australia globally. despite existence several policies suppress issue youth delinquency rise. the increasing rates youth felony prompted policymakers scholars research alternative ways addressing issue. however deferring views cause ways controlling youth crime policymakers scholars public complicated process finding appropriate solutions. public comments proposed changes queensland parliament explicitly illustrates society far establishing coherent strategy address youth delinquency. the commentaries posted public article implicitly posit youth offending classical theory perspective. the comments illustrate public believes juveniles commit criminal acts individual choices rational considerations. this position severally challenges academic literature youth justice postulates significant difference youth adult offenders. public views youth delinquency significantly rely existing implicit theories youth offending. according shoemaker 2010 implicit theories personal constructions particular condition occurrence exist mind individuals. these constructions differ according people. as cunneen whites richards 2015 expound implicit theories characteristically equivocal inconsistent explaining occurrence. additionally personal constructions tend descriptive deductive explanation phenomenon. as result several theories exist youth delinquency. each perspective strives persuade public position relevant. in spite discrepancies implicit youth delinquency theories vital understanding factors propagate youth offending direct policy formulation. in courier mail naming shaming comments main concepts youth offending reflected publics comments conform classical strain delinquency theories. however significant percentage public founded comments classical youth delinquency theory. according cunneen whites richards 2015 classical theory posits young people rational individuals free ability make choices. the classical theory suggests person engages criminal acts intentionally calculating costs benefits actions. in respect theory rules effects externalities youth delinquency. as illustrated comment one member public criminals accountable actions regardless age since commit crime intentionally. consequently majority commented article supported naming shaming young offenders. moreover even suggested delinquent youths shamed alongside parents. according one individuals commented post naming shaming offenders act deterrent measure. however argue naming shaming offenders sufficient disciplinary move. instead insist corporal punishment accompany naming shaming. as depicted comments section public naming shaming offenders without severe punishment could escalate rate youth delinquency. this punitive view summarizes stand employ classical approach youth felony. as marina king 2009 expound studies show use classical perspective youth offending likely punitive utilize strain theory. on hand commented post strain theory viewpoint. the strain theory employs positivists school thought criminology. in view section public argued social strains poor parenting economic hardships ineffective policies motive youths engage criminal acts. the strain theory argues crime goes beyond free will. the difference individuals applied classical theory strain theory comments latter use coercive force handle young offenders. this section public indicated use coercive force one drivers teenage delinquency. moreover stated naming shaming offenders longterm solution. considering emotions one key drivers criminal acts naming shaming offenders could inflict strain young people escalating rate crimes. as argued one comments eradicating social economic inequalities way address issue youth delinquency. besides argued strain theory perspective pointed naming shaming young offenders could lead stigmatization. in modern society good reputation essential success. consequently naming shaming young offenders could adversely affect future success people negative presumptions behaviors. with psychologists confirming humans change behaviors irrational condemn young people without solving social forces compel participate criminal acts. academic literature tends agree disagree comments made post. particularly scholars differ comments measures implemented address youth delinquency. from comments evident majority public prefers use punitive strategies address delinquency issues. however reynolds crea 2015 indicate youth delinquency complex issue influenced multiple factors. the complexity issues implies motivated free social strain. interestingly maahs pratt 2017 posit public opinion youth delinquency based scientific research. instead based societal assumptions. as result opinions biased insufficient informing policy formulation. according maahs pratt 2017 use imprisonment punishment way combat youth offending strategy lacks objectivity. in comments significant percentage public supported naming shaming policy effective measure suppress youth crime. however move delve key external forces compel young people commit criminal acts. studies also refute notion criminal activities based personal decisions. a significant percentage public posted young people engaged crime intentionally. however according ciardha gannon 2012 criminal activities prompted psychological distress. moreover ciardha gannon 2012 point social learning influences offenses. in respect nature society shapes behaviors young people. this argument challenges deliberations classical theories. instead society assuming youth delinquency intentional embrace multiple factors motivate condition. however academic literature seems significant support commented strain theory perspective. according hoeve mcreynolds wasserman 2014 classical theories prove insignificant particularly case recidivism. from comments majority people supported naming shaming frequent offenders. however hoeve mcreynolds wasserman 2014 advise instead punishing recidivists subjected psychological screening establish mental wellbeing. notably studies established positive correlation youth recidivism mental disorders. in particular baglivio et al. 2016 maintain maltreatment offenders increases possibilities reoffending. this view contradicts public support naming shaming delinquent youths. naming shaming criminals psychological maltreatments permanent damage persons emotions. despite adversities hoeve mcreynolds wasserman 2014 state majority people support harsh punishments youth offenders since believe deters criminal activities. furthermore scholars disapprove equal treatment youth adult offenders. according cunneen et al. 2015 youth offenders legally incompetent equated adults. the public shown massive support keeping distinct boundaries young adult offenders. according farrington loeber howell 2017 widely accepted age affects decisionmaking ability individuals. in view young offenders handled adult delinquents since differ decisionmaking abilities. however farrington loeber howell 2017 agree leniency law motivated juveniles commit criminal offenses. unlike views presented majority comments article public prefers rehabilitative coercive approach addressing youth delinquency. according pealer terry adams 2017 public understands young people still developmental stage behaviors easily altered. in fact society significantly advocated abolishment youth imprisonment. this revelation contrasts views presented called harsh punishment young offenders comments section. conclusively comments public courier mail article theorize youth offending perspective classical strain theories. while significant percentage public posted youth offenders treated equally adult criminals view contradicts one academic literature public opinion youth crime. however agree public tends support punitive framework

several hypothesis postulated order ascertain affect sleep deprivation degree mental alertness. this essay discusses two important hypothesis postulated domain sleep deprivation tries finds significance two hypotheses light six different research papers conducted similar domain. hypothesis 1 sustained attention performance during sleep deprivation evidence state instability according hypothesis postulated doran dongen dinges sleep deprivation humans eradicate strength deliver neurobehavioral functions contrary creates imbalance state alertness sleep deprived individual preventing maintain stable pr alert performance minute. sleep deprivation significant affect performance variability expressed intermittent lapsing. this sleep deprivation affects causes state instability along escalating homeostatic drive sleep uncontrolled initiation sleep strong resistance prevent sleep using compensatory effort. this state instability affects neurobehavioral performance. this imbalance neurobehavioral performance causes moment moment divergence attention associated homeostatic drive sleep circadian promotion wakefulness. the psychomotor vigilance test pvt using done via implementing 88 hours sleep deprivation conducted order prove hypothesis. the obtained results showed controlled group allowed take 2 hours nap every 12 hours 88 hours total performed better pvt. moreover results also showed performance variability kept awake 18 hours stretch declines rapidly accompanied lack motivation doran et al. 2001 . however hypothesis claims state instability eliminate sustained neurobehavioral responses. it hampers decelerates specific neurobehavioral functions like alertness problem solving skills psychomotor skills promoting false responding. a sleep deprived person able perform short term task alertness difficulty duration task increases sleep deprived persons faces problems problem increases tenure sleep deprivation doran et al. 2001 . hypothesis 2 prefrontal neuropsychological effects sleep deprivation young adultsa model healthy aging the prefrontal complex portion brain mainly responsible variety different complex behaviors includes planning well contributes personal development. this located front frontal lobe brain. authors found integral link people live along personality development functions prefrontal cortex. they also contribute decision making moderating social behaviour. however authors developed hypothesis states sleep deprivation young adults results impairment prefrontal cortex similar preferential impairment occurs old age people time healthy aging. authors opinion young people suffer sleep deprivation results changes prefrontal complex pattern similar modification occur naturally prefrontal region brain old people. therefore put forward hypothesis conduct research models taking sleep deprived patients younger cohort would able study normal process aging brain old would beneficial invention new facts harrison horne rothwell 2000 . comparison hypothesis both hypothesis reflects two different arenas research. the first hypothesis mainly determines activity prefrontal cortex sleep deprived young people. this hypothesis mainly talk choosing model alterations occurring brain sleep deprived young individuals according authors comparable alteration take place healthy aging old people. on hypothesize authors mainly stressed performance level individuals working asleep deprived condition. in hypothesis authors state long sleep deprived individuals seen provide forced compensatory effort help accomplish short time tasks fail provide concentration attention asked complete long sustained task requires continuous attention. if individuals provided naps lapses frequency reduces resulting better concentration. otherwise individuals sleep deprived frequent sleep attacks well lapses ultimately result individual go uncontrollable sleep eliminate wakefulness individual. a number studies conducted far order ascertain basis two abovementioned hypotheses. the current essay sheds light two abovementioned hypotheses hold true deviated actual case scenarios. the comparison relatedness hypotheses done via analysing 6 research papers framed specifically ascertain significance two hypotheses. increasing task difficulty facilitates cerebral compensatory response total sleep deprivation study conducted sean group researchers year 2004. their aim study analyse affect task difficulty cerebral compensatory response total sleep deprived people. here participants asked perform modified version baddeleys logical reasoning task monitored via magnetic resonance imagining. they monitored twice normal tenure sleep 35 long hours total sleep deprivation. the task also simultaneously modified order parametrically manipulate level task difficulty. the participants young age mean 27.6 + 6.1 years . the results showed degree task difficulty facilitates cerebral compensatory response tenure total sleep deprivation. this compensatory response found express new new regions brain otherwise relation task demand normal well rested condition. moreover stronger compensatory responses generated regions brain significantly related process undergoing task well rested condition drummond et al. 2004 . this study works sync hypothesis 1 sustained action performance states sleep deprived person able perform short term task alertness via generating compensatory response brain doran et al. 2001 . the paper lapsing sleep deprivation is associated distributed changes brain activation authored researchers chee et al. year 2008. twenty four right handled male female patients allocated experiment 17 subjects ultimately incorporated experiential setting. they visited laboratory three times time predefined activities. after conducting activities tests taken researchers found sleep depression resulted slower well less accurate variable performance also affected different task related activity performance. lapses also found associated reduction virtual cortical activities sd patients. the researchers performed functional magnetic resonance imaging visual well selective attention task mainly noticed correct responses trial trail pattern modelled effects response. when comparison done sleep deprived individuals individuals taking normal night sleep found lapses differ previous reduced ability frontal parietal region raise activation respond lapses resulted reduction activation visual sensory cortex reduced thalamic activation lapses comparison elevated activation non lapse period chee et al. 2008 . this theory inculcate mixing hypothesis authors used prefrontal characteristic changes sleep deprived patients like first hypothesis showed effect brain function normal activity level participants regular tasks like second hypothesis. chee choo conducted experiments published work functional imaging working memory 24 hr total sleep deprivation published year 2004. the authors mainly incorporated 14 participants young right handed. the main motive study analyze neurobehavioral effects 24 hour sleep young adults. before conducting magnetic resonance imaging allowed go two tests lts plus one testing maintenance four blocks manipulation maintenance three blocks. response time sleep deprivation tasks slower. an interesting observation found here. different patterns changes occurred different portion parietal frontal portions brain result cognitive impairment brain regions sleep deprivation. however increased prefrontal thalamic activation helps participants undertake compensatory adaptation. all finding papers help researchers come conclusion complex tasks well done sleep deprived individuals simple tasks. this based first hypothesis researchers mainly discussed brain regions related functional modifications also stated model matches occurrences changes elder adults chee choo 2004 . drummond et al. published paper sleep deprivationinduced reduction cortical functional response serial subtraction year 1999. they main aim studying effects sleep deprivation different functional alteration brain thereby study changes. for taken thirteen normal healthy subjects taking written consents. they made perform 4 different tasks twice day time fmri scans done normal night sleep one sleep deprived sleep. arithmetic tasks mainly conducted. the authors wanted know whether prefrontal cortex parietal lobe alterations due affects sd. it seen comparison normal night sleep activities mentioned regions brain decreased sleep deprivation especially pfc drummond et al. 1999 . the work aligns first hypothesis main discussion remains concerned effects different parts brain related functional decrease functional loss. the study the neural basis psychomotor vigilance test conducted drummond group researchers year 2005. the aim study identify regions brains promote fastest slowest reaction times psychomotor vigilance test pvt . the study conducted wellrested conditions particularly directed towards specific regions brain deliver extremely poor performance tenure sleep deprivation. the study conducted 20 right handed healthy adults age mean 27.4 + 6.7 years made undergo two pvts giving pvt brains analysed magnetic resonance imaging. these two pvt tests performed every 12 hours waking normal night sleep 36 hours total sleep deprivation. the results obtained showed optimal performance brain pvt test depends activation sustained attention system motor system. the poor performance following pvt recorded total sleep deprivation result poor attention. however order make poor performance brain times elicit compensatory response particular positions brain responsible fast attentive performance. these findings accordance hypothesis 1 sustained action performance states poor performance individuals pvt tsd result decrease mental alertness poor attention. the brain fails stay alert prolong hours sleep deprivation hence provides poor result pvt doran et al. 2001 . the aim study neural basis alertness cognitive performance impairments sleepiness. i. effects 24 h sleep deprivation waking human regional brain activity conducted thomas et al. year 2000 analyse significance hypothesis states negative effects sleep deprivation alertness cognitive performance result decrease activity brain mainly sub cortical region prefrontal cortex. in order conduct study thomas et al. performed positron emission tomography pet 17 normal subjects sleep deprived 85 hours. they used fluorine 2deoxyglucose fdg marker detect cerebral metabolic rate glucose cmrglu simultaneous neuronal synaptic activity. 2 scans per subject done per 24 hours intervals. the study showed short term sleep deprivation results global decrease brain activity significant decrease global cmrglu. this study works sync hypotheses. it proved influence prefrontal cortex neuropsychological effects sleep deprivation also indicated sleep deprivation cast negative impact cognitive performance alertness doran et al. 2001 harrison horne rothwell 2000 . thus discussion concluded sleep deprivation prominent

ieee.', 'management accounting answer a. the playdough company manufacturing canister involves different costs. the cost involves variable cost fixed cost. cost per unit calculated dividing total cost number canisters berman knight case 2013 . manufacturing cost per unit particulars amount direct material 300000 direct labour 180000 variable overhead 120000 fixed overhead 540000 total cost 1140000 number canister 760000 cost per canister 1.5 answer b. the company present situation produces 760000 canisters every year entire production sold. recently company got offer outside canisters outside. let us first take decision basis financial factors profitability. we compare profits inhouse manufacturing profits canisters bought outside bragg 2014 . the reduction total cost obviously increase profits. from given two tables easily see difference profits earned company calculation profit manufacturing particulars amount sales 1672000 less direct material 300000 direct labour 180000 variable overhead 120000 fixed overhead 540000 profit 532000 calculation profit purchase particulars amount sales 1672000 less direct material 300000 direct labour 180000 variable overhead 120000 fixed overhead 432000 profit 640000 we observe fixed overhead case outsourcing reduced reduction machinery depreciation 28000 supervisors salary 80000 led increase profits selling price cases maintained 2.2. there increase profits 640000532000 108000. hence easy draw conclusion management consideration financial factors accept order. answer c. a company initially tries retrieve variable costs experienced hopes reclaim fixed costs. it necessary us compute contribution calculated withdrawing value variable cost sales figure. the value variable cost influenced amount production hand fixed costs persistent effect even production level increased decreased. to take decision must carefully compare analyze contribution normal sales also contribution special orders brigham ehrhardt 2017 . the contribution company presentable higher shows companys ability recover fixed cost. also process come know special order profit lower contribution recover fixed cost really low gitman zutter 2012 . still following working make much easier understand company refuse special orders calculation showing profit neglecting acceptance special order amount sales 1672000 less direct material 300000 direct labour 180000 variable overhead 120000 fixed overhead 540000 profit 532000 calculation showing profit acceptance special order particulars amount sales 1656000 less direct material 300000 direct labour 180000 variable overhead 120000 fixed overhead 540000 profit 516000 the playdough companys maximum total capacity 760000 units. so company accept special orders selling 20000 units 1.4 remaining 740000 units 2.2. thus terminal impact companys profit observed result fall sales price hoyle schaefer doupnik 2015 . so according study company take special order. answer d it clearly stated solution part c companies refuse accept special order basis financial position. however thinking making profit always main agenda. sometimes companies take decisions based factors also. to make money future need sacrifice profit short period time. the acceptance offer may improve relationship company client may prove profitable financially companys reputation. also many opponents market may accept proposal provide satisfaction customers result set back company hence able compete opponent also longer able meet requirements industry ehrhardt brigham 2011 . answer e the playdough company currently production sales 760000 canisters every year helps gain profits worth 532000 shown below. the company proposes produce 400 000 coffee cups every year results small profit 60000 only. calculation profit manufacturing particulars amount sales 1672000 less direct material 300000 direct labour 180000 variable overhead 120000 fixed overhead 540000 profit 532000 profit sale coffee cups per unit sales 1.2 less direct material 0.6 direct labour 0.2 variable overhead 0.1 fixed overhead 0.15 profit sale coffee cups per unit 0.15 profit 400000 cups 60000 hence clearly stated calculations companys production canisters continue. also possibility company may able increase profits. if company creates canisters abandons idea making coffee cups start earning profits amounting 532000. the company also different option producing coffee cups buying canisters outsiders helping firm maximize profit garrison noreen brewer 2012 . the statement proved following calculations calculation profit purchase canisters particulars amount sales 1672000 less direct material 300000 direct labour 180000 variable overhead 120000 fixed overhead 432000 profit 640000 profit sale coffee cups per unit sales 1.2 less direct material 0.6 direct labour 0.2 variable overhead 0.1 fixed overhead 0.15 profit sale coffee cups per unit 0.15 profit 400000 cups 60000 calculation total profit amount profit canister purchase 640000 profit coffee cups 60000 total profit 700000 so mentioned calculation clearly stated company start buying canisters outside start producing coffee shop best option helping improve profit. as observed incurring less profit producing canisters alternative producing coffee mugs help maximize profit. answer f there several reasons needed considered drawing conclusion. before taking special order company first look upon financial position. if financial aspects satisfactory nonfinancial aspects company taken consideration cafferky 2014 . nonfinancial aspects taken consideration finalizing decisions follows quality manufactured product it happen company produces good quality product product purchased outside may meet desired quality product. hence quality check process carried coming conclusion. delivery time the company discuss everything delivery time due failure delivery time order may reduced cause financial loss also nonfinancial loss. reputation the companys reputation may damaged quality product supplied before. any unsatisfactory factor like delay delivery goods arises outsourcing may result damage companys reputation. references berman k. knight j.

economics. economics widely known subject scarcity allocation. the primary problem economists deal every resource world limited. given scarcity constraint primary challenge subject becomes efficient utilization fruitful allocation resources present achieve best outcomes welfare productivity terms barnett morse 2013 . the essay discusses different aspects christian worldview applications field subject economics. this worldview tries seek relevance current day economic situations incidents ideas society given bible tries provide solutions suggestions regarding eradications problems according biblical principles byfaith 2017 . the purpose essay elaborate different aspects applicability biblebased worldview current day economics find connection worldview contemporary economic crisis. christian worldview economics according christian school thought problems humankind faces current days result failure fall man himself. christbased worldview suggests men given role supervising creations god. however due course time greed unethical ways things achieve materialistic pleasure took away title stewardship men kim mccalman fisher 2012 . economics subject science started losing ethics strong spiritual background past. this school tries bring back ethics economics keeping parity spiritual foundation have. the christbased view economics several aspects discussed follows the primary aspect christian school economics supporter capitalism. the general notion capitalism though go standard notion equity welfare christian school thought differs. according view distribute fruits hard work capable people among people economy including nonproductive ones name equity overall welfare latter key component communism maritain 2012 . the christian school argue god allocated much facilities people deserve according much work done shaharir 2012 . they draw reference incident failure starvation pilgrims plymouth rock america 1620. it mentioned bible pilgrims tried set society resembling communist pattern failed hard working class lost interest produce hard earned fruits labour shared nonworking class thereby resulting overall size production level. this aspect though sounds little rude society whole hold relevance current economic scenarios well. common property resources always matter debate exclusion mahanta das 2012 . for example common grass field gazing cattle particular village villagers entitled facility. however grass abundant consumption grass one portion field ones cattle automatically reduces share persons cattle. every economy across world experiences problem free riders especially public sector battaglini nunnari palfray 2012 . the taxpayers money used develop infrastructures country benefit nontax payers well thereby reducing willingness taxpayers contribute economy. merit goods like education though ideally provided every citizen economy government often faces lack sufficient number providers due problem shared welfare. the biblebased view economics understands production significantly important ingredient subject. in fact key focus economics. production based needs human beings products available needing affordable prices. keeping mind christian school economics argue production done keeping mind business perspective well. production create profit surplus even compensating factors participating process. this profit important constituent future expansion production well growth future economy. the second aspect school deals profit angle production. this notion profit business highly applicable study economics. profit serves incentive producers increases willingness invest production process mel schlag 2015 . in many cases earn profit pose welfare problems economy form underpayment unethical overutilization factors participating production especially labour. in spite shortcoming profit remains one key incentives among investors invest produce. another significant aspect worldview concept scarcity. scarcity always treated primary problem subject economics. as discussed earlier important economic decisions country individual depends much resources present needs resources allocated much resources allocated sector need. the overview problem give notion scarcity bad driving scarcity lead solution economic problems worldwide. however christian school differs perspective. according poverty real economic hurdle scarcity not. god wanted men face scarcity along free choose. this means face scarcity human beings learn acknowledge true value resources use judiciously produce much possible. had resources abundantly present society people would felt urge productive thereby leading downfall society claar clay 2015 . this aspect like previous two holds true extent study economics nowadays. inefficient utilization abundant wastage economic resources invariably leads constantly degrading economy deficits every sector. poverty inequality lack provisions meet bare necessities underdevelopment byproducts inefficient production directly indirectly stapleford 2015 . conclusion it evident discourse though biblical worldviews dated centuries back still hold much relevance current day world least far subject economics concerned. most principle foundations school thought tries explains real life economic issues considerable extent compromising spiritual way thinking. it may true economic problems far complex degree complexity ever increasing time. even christcentred biblebased worldview completely lost applicability field economics. modifications specific current

strengths weaknesses proposition precautionary principle part customary international law 2017 student details 14sep17 introduction environmental law aspect law operates complicated areas high level scientific uncertainty. for majority activities require change environment precise determination effects human health environment remains almost impossible determined. usually scientific evidence available gives cause concern though able give information could deemed conclusive. when happens risk assessment requires balance attained need protecting environment advantages foregone strict restrictions deemed unnecessary. and context role precautionary principle raised. a proposition legal scholars presented regard precautionary principle attained level customary international law. in following parts proposition analysed whereby strengths weakness highlighted understand proposition actually true. but done basics precautionary principle highlighted. precautionary principle precautionary principle tool used betterment environmental health decisions. the aim precautionary principle safeguard harm start instead managing already taken place. to put laymans language better safe sorry. this principle denotes duty preventing harm power even absence evidence show that. hence principle notion whereby protective action supported scientific proof establish risk sense action prolonged absence scientific information. in short principle conveys common sense based viewpoint err side caution. so aim safeguard humans environment broadly ecosystem harm. the precautionary principle acts guiding principle purpose encourage even oblige decision markers considering possible harmful effects actions undertaken environment even go forward activities. the proponents principle see new progressive policy instrument strive reversal shift present position polluters allowed go forward continue discharge different forms substance sin biosphere. a long time passed since humankind continued act short term interest profit progress instead long term focus welfare health planet earth. this led known situation whereby human society discovers already extensive irreversible damage caused environment already difficulty faced coping consequences. rule customary international law there one set legal commentators argued favour precautionary principle level customary law due strengths proposition. conversely others state precautionary principle attained status due principle quite vague interpreted different manner also accepted majority world national level effectively highlighting weakness proposition. there also one description principle states principle evolving culturally framed concept takes cue everchanging views regarding pertinent role economics politics law ethics science proactive environmental management well protection. in number ways principle shows legal concepts even new. a proponent principle james cameron highlighted different principles already exist view indirectly precautionary measures. the key one regard concept strict liability tort whereby absolute liability thee conducted activities provided deemed abnormally dangerous nature instance burial environmental waste. james highlighted probability responsible part held strictly liable reasonable care given weighatge result actors required careful consider costs potential liabilities act. another key point insurance mechanisms act evidence precautionary measures already present system. third key point regard principles analogized environment impact assessment. and significant connection established example national environmental protection act us whereby agencies required prepare environmental impact statement regarding important federal actions significantly affect human environment quality. this model number nations similar laws created. rio declarations principle 17 instructive. and environmental impact assessments type compulsory information provision precautionary effects resemble ones make environmental empowerment possible deemed precautionary enabling devices. the final point basis proposition favoured uncertainty thing intrinsic part scientific process possible scientific manner prove fact cent percent surety. the primary base science prove theory wrong prove conclusive manner. even high majority scientific community standing favour something always tend disagree thus level uncertainty always present. the proponents principle acknowledged irrefutable reality time highlighted certain problems different layer different kinds scientific issues giving rise number layers uncertainty. this complexity gives rise concern ultimately highlights weakness proposition. the higher uncertainties present higher becomes possibility unforseen even unrelated factors could result changed result prediction regarding possibility harm. in short risk profile problems changed. as result added complexities proponents stated principle theory essentially remain guidance policies even though imperfect instead considering customary law. an unsolved question opens channel gates number debates whether precautionary principle become customary international law. the international court justices statute defines customary international law international custom proof general practices accepted law. included elements customary international law duration generality practice opinion juris uniformity consistency practice. precautionary principle given status customary international law holds significance rule customary law results creation states save ones continue object practice legal consequences it. the cases north sea continental shelf nicaragua act complement article statue international court justice clarified two requirements customary international law. as per court customary international law raised nation follows practice extensive also uniform manner virtually along practice followed conviction compulsory based international law. hence opposition certain set states seem interfere development customary rule. yet best indicators practice state continue instrument state international law. at present principle used around 90 international agreements declaration. and regard number states signing declaration ratifications shows broad acceptance rule states. such set scholars support idea principle indeed part customary law provide different contentions. the first one regard principle adopted number international treaties deemed authority circumstances establishing presence duties customary law. the next contention number decisions handed international tribunals courts deemed proof practices states support adoption principle. the next point support proposition high number national laws implementing principle national courts also adopting judgements. and due reasons patrons insisted precautionary principle approach twenty years evolution become approach least deemed principle customary international law. the set scholars covers individual criticize proposition provide certain bases rejecting principle customary international law. the significant common one regard principle vague acknowledged governments different nations irrespective magnitude proper protection environment. also also clear critics regarding whether approach principle. in case rio declaration deemed principles embodiment precautionary approach advocated precautionary principle. this means precaution deemed lawful rule instead needs deemed method. in addition precautionary principle already incorporated national laws make difficult prove consistency uniformity consistency existence practice. the important problem relates challenges faced treating law compliance enforcement opponents prove yet law prove effective like laws protecting human rights per se indigenous people. hence status precautionary principle continues uncertain. and cannot used resolve conflict due lack effectiveness principle law. often also clash uploading principle law due self interest nation put international law thus claiming principle lacking status law. conclusion the previous segment makes clear remains unclear precautionary principle deemed customary international law. the major developments surrounding principle cannot ignored international context. and without doubt precautionary principle influenced decision making process significant manner national international levels. though one also cannot deny remain number flaws haps principle require improved deemed customary law. there hence need widely accepted definition precautionary principle drawn formal manner international community earliest. more importantly need resolve problem principle approach issue. in addition need general consistent practices
